ðŸ”¥ 1. Buffered Streams

Buffered streams improve performance by reducing direct I/O operations with the disk.

try (BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream("input.txt"));
     BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("output.txt"))) {

    int data;
    while ((data = bis.read()) != -1) {
        bos.write(data);
    }
}
âœ… Use BufferedInputStream/OutputStream when reading/writing large files.
